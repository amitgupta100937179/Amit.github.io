	Description: This is a HTML file linked with external CSS Script and Java Scrip which will generate a webpage with multiple
                 balls of different color bouncing around the screen which will change color on each collision. There is also a 
                 Evil circle which will eat the balls if it catches them. There will be a score counter to track the number of balls
                 left to capture.
